#Food Truck Project

### Overview

This program asks the user for some inputs about the food truck and then displays the average and highest rated food trucks.

The user is initially asked to enter the names of food trucks of their liking. They are then asked to enter the food type and what they thought about the food in the form of rating (1-5). The data is stored in FoodTruck.java and the main method is the FoodTruckApp.java. I created some static and private fields in the FoodTruck class. I have some constructors, and also getter and setters for the data that the user inputs.

Inside FoodTruckApp.java I have two primary methods except the main method. I created a diplayMenu method which is the interactive portion of the program. The second method is createFoodTruck methods which as the name implies, creates and store data in the form of array of length 5. Inside the createFoodTruck method I called averageRating, highestRating and existingTrucks methods.
